# Multi-function-Inception-v4

An example of a Multi-function Inception-v4 model is created.
There are 4 python files, and main.py is the file to run.

All together, from these scripts, several multi-function Inception-v4 and several single-function Inception-v4 models are created, trained, and tested on a dataset. For evaluation, training accuracy and test accuracy are calculated for all CNN models.

Currently, the activation functions are randomly chosen for all neurons in a conv block from a set of activation functions defined by the user.

To run the code:
```
python3 main.py
```
