# Multi-function-Inception-v4

An example of a Multi-function Inception-v4 model is created.
There are 4 python files, and main.py is the file to run.

All together, fron these scripts, several multi-function Inception-v4 and single-function Inception-v4 models get created, trained, and tested on a dataset. For evaluation, training and test accuracy are calculated.

Currently, the activation functions are randomly chosen for all neurons in a conv block from a set defined by the user.
